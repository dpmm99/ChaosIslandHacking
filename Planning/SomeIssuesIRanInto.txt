Game wouldn't run on Windows 7
Made Windows XP VM, wouldn't run game
Made Windows 98 VM
	Tried using OllyDbg
	Put lots of breakpoints on lots of things, until I got used to it
	Eventually realized game took control of screen and mouse so I couldn't use a debugger well
	Couldn't find API calls for a while because DirectDraw uses an interface (Codewalker saved me)
	Couldn't use a memory breakpoint like Codewalker suggested
	Eventually edited game code in 6+ locations (CreateWindow, ChangeDisplaySettings, SetCapture, DirectDraw APIs, and window event handler) after multiple attempts, couldn't wrest control from game's grasp
	Thought about remote debug, but no options work for 98
Made Windows XP VM
	Game still took screen control, so I tried remote debugging (spent several hours)
	Tried using virtual COM to connect
	Tried using TCP to connect
	WinDbg would only connect in Kernel mode, which is ugly, via named pipe
	Edited Windows XP in two ways to enable Remote Desktop connections (took half an hour or so)
	Connected through Remote Desktop and was able to use OllyDbg on half the screen
	Read over 500 lines of assembly (took a few hours) before I found the decompression procedure
	Accidentally skipped the entire second pass of the decompression, it seems
And throughout the whole process, I stopped numerous times to see if I could figure out more of the decompression mechanics just by thinking and looking at the raw data
