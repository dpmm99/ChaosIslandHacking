There's 1 TXT file: dinfo.txt. Contains dinosaur info of some sort...
There's 1 UDF file: unittileset.udf
set.bin and chaos.cnt in the game directory are plain text.
Who knows what all the data in SAVEGAME could be?
levelobjanim.ldf has unique info in it


I'm pretty sure most of the map trigger data is hardcoded. There are lots of strings like "You need to find the Artificial Nest." in the EXE.



The following are parameters you may find in map files.

It looks like you cannot put Remdul on a map directly, as there is no "remdul" string. The same goes for "grunt" (an apparently unused ogre-looking sprite) and "mib" (an also apparently unused Men-In-Black sprite).
